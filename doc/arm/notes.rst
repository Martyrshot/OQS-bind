Introduction
------------

BIND 9.17 is an unstable development release of BIND. This document
summarizes new features and functional changes that have been introduced
on this branch. With each development release leading up to the stable
BIND 9.18 release, this document will be updated with additional
features added and bugs fixed. Please see the CHANGES file for a more
detailed list of changes and bug fixes.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

To build on Unix-like systems, BIND requires support for POSIX.1c
threads (IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995), the Advanced Sockets API for IPv6
(:rfc:`3542`), and standard atomic operations provided by the C
compiler.

The libuv asynchronous I/O library and the OpenSSL cryptography library
must be available for the target platform. A PKCS#11 provider can be
used instead of OpenSSL for Public Key cryptography (i.e., DNSSEC
signing and validation), but OpenSSL is still required for general
cryptography operations such as hashing and random number generation.

More information can be found in the ``PLATFORMS.md`` file that is
included in the source distribution of BIND 9. If your compiler and
system libraries provide the above features, BIND 9 should compile and
run. If that is not the case, the BIND development team will generally
accept patches that add support for systems that are still supported by
their respective vendors.

End of Life
-----------

BIND 9.17 is an unstable development branch. When its development is
complete, it will be renamed to BIND 9.18, which will be a stable
branch. The end-of-life date for BIND 9.18 has not yet been determined.
For those needing long-term stability, the current Extended Support
