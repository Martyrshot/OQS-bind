Known Issues
------------

- Upgrading from BIND 9.16.32, 9.18.6, 9.19.4, or any older version may
  require a manual configuration change. The following configurations
  are affected:

  - :any:`type primary` zones configured with :any:`dnssec-policy` but
    without either :any:`allow-update` or :any:`update-policy`,
  - :any:`type secondary` zones configured with :any:`dnssec-policy`.

  In these cases please add :namedconf:ref:`inline-signing yes;
  <inline-signing>` to the individual zone configuration(s). Without
  applying this change, :iscman:`named` will fail to start. For more
  details, see
  https://kb.isc.org/docs/dnssec-policy-requires-dynamic-dns-or-inline-signing

- According to :rfc:`8310`, Section 8.1, the ``Subject`` field MUST NOT
  be inspected when verifying a remote certificate while establishing a
  DNS-over-TLS connection. Only ``subjectAltName`` must be checked
  instead. Unfortunately, some quite old versions of cryptographic
  libraries might lack the ability to ignore the ``Subject`` field. This
  should have minimal production-use consequences, as most of the
  production-ready certificates issued by certificate authorities will
  have ``subjectAltName`` set. In such cases, the ``Subject`` field is
  ignored. Only old platforms are affected by this, e.g. those supplied
  with OpenSSL versions older than 1.1.1. :gl:`#3163`
